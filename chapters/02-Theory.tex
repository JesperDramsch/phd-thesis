\chapter{Methods \& Theory}

This thesis applies \acl{ml} methods to 4D seismic data. In this chapter I introduce 4D seismic concepts and the motivation to acquire and analyze 4D seismic data. I go on to introduce machine learning and review the development of machine learning in itself and in the field of geoscience. The focus on this thesis is on \aclp{nn}, particularly \aclp{dl} to geophysical problems. Considering recent developments in computer vision, a focus on \aclp{cnn}, the developments and break-throughs of this type of \ac{nn} and the innovations that lead to the recent adoption of \acl{ml} in geoscience are explored.

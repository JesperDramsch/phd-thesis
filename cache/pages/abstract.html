<div class="line">Machine Learning provides a tool for the modelling and analysis of
geoscientific data. I have placed recent developments in deep learning
into the greater context of machine learning by reviewing the
approaches and challenges of the use of machine learning in
geoscience. The thesis consists of six peer-reviewed publications and
one submitted journal paper. Furthermore, five peer-reviewed
publications are placed in the appendix.</div>
<div class="line">The aim of this thesis is to apply recent developments in computer
vision systems, neural networks, and machine learning to geoscientific
data, particularly 4D seismic analysis. Neural networks are a type of
machine learning that has made significant contributions to modern
artificial intelligence and automation. The applicability of neural
networks for their capability of being a universal function
approximator was recognized within geophysics from an early stage.
Following the recent interest in deep learning, neural networks have
experienced a renaissance in geoscience applications, particularly in
automatic seismic interpretation, inversion processes and sequence
modelling.</div>
<div class="line">This is followed by an exploration of unsupervised machine learning to
segment chalk sediments in back-scatter scanning electron microscopy
data. The next chapter shows that using neural networks pre-trained on
natural images can reduce the data necessary for transfer learning to
geoscience problems. This is followed by a chapter showing that
complex-valued convolutions can stabilize training and data
compression on non-stationary physical data. Subsequently,
pressure-saturation data is extracted from 4D seismic amplitude
difference maps using a novel deep dense sample-based encoder-decoder
network. The network contains a low-assumption physical basis
(Amplitude Versus Offset) as explicit features and learns the residual
for the regression of the &quot;inversion&quot; data. This work shows that
transfer from simulation data to field data is possible.</div>
<div class="line">Finally, an unsupervised method is devised to extract 3D time-shifts
from two 4D seismic cubes. The network extracts these 3D time-shifts
including uncertainty measures. Commonly, time-shifts are extracted in
1D, due to processing speed, computational cost and poor performance
of 3D methods. Within the training loop, the stationary velocity field
is numerically integrated to obtain 3D time shifts that are
constrained by the topology in a geologically consistent manner. The
unsupervised implementation of the network structure ensures that
biases from other time-shift extraction methods are not implicitly
included in the network. This application utilizes unsupervised
learning by devising a way of behaviour for the network to follow
instead of supplying ground truth labels. Moreover, this results in a
way to increase trust in the system, by limiting the extraction
process to the deep learning system and performing well-defined
operations within the network to automate the unsupervised training.</div>

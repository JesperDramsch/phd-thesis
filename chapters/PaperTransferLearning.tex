\chapter{Deep learning seismic facies on state of the art CNN architectures}

We explore propagation of seismic interpretation by deep learning in stacked 2D sections. We show the application of state-of-the-art image classification algorithms on seismic data. These algorithms were trained on big labeled photograph databases. We use transfer learning to benefit from pre-trained networks and evaluate their performance on seismic data.

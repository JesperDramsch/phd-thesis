4D seismic is the analysis of seismic data that was acquired over the same location after some calendar time has passed. The repeated imaging of the same subsurface location highlights changes in the subsurface that can lead to improved understanding of subsurface processes and fluid movement.
Exploration &amp; Production companies, in particular, have an interest in imaging hydrocarbon reservoirs \citep{Johnston2013-jg}. However, 4D seismic imaging has broad applications for subsurface characterization, such as observing volcanic activity \citep{londono20184d} or CO\textsubscript{2} sequestration monitoring \citep{Arts2004-ym}.</p>
<p>The main applications of 4D seismic analysis, according to \citet{Yilmaz2003-hp,Johnston2013-qg} include:
- Tracking fluid movement (steam, gas, and water)
- Monitoring pressure depletion and validating depletion plans
- Fault property estimation, i.e. sealing or leaking faults
- Locating bypassed oil in heterogeneous reservoirs
- Validating and updating geological and reservoir-simulation models</p>
<p>4D seismic data analysis suffers from the superposition of multiple effects on seismic imaging. These effects include changes in the acquisition equipment due to technological advances, changes in acquisition geometry (source-receiver mismatch), as well as physical changes in the subsurface \citep{Yilmaz2003-hp, Johnston2013-jg}. These physical changes are in part due to fluid movement in the subsurface \citep{lumley1995seismic}, as well as, geological changes due to compaction and expansion \citep{Hatchell2005-op}. These geomechanical effects change the position of the reflectors, the thickness of stratigraphy, and the physical properties such as density and wave velocity \citep{Herwanger2015-qz}.</p>
<p>Successful 4D applications rely on careful acquisition planning, closely matching the mismatch of the source ($\Delta S$) and receiver ($\Delta R$). This awareness has generally improved the repeatability of seismic acquisition; however, the \ac{nrms} remains to be an essential measure of noise sources that deteriorate the 4D seismic analysis. Moreover, 4D seismic analysis has brought to light that some 3D seismic processing workflows are not as repeatable and amplitude-preserving as they were thought to be \citep{Lumley2001-kx}. Modern processing flows include co-processing of the base and monitor seismic volumes with specialized tools to reduce differences from processing \citep{Johnston2013-qg}.</p>
<p>The standard analysis tool in 4D seismic interpretation is amplitude differences \citep{Johnston2013-jg}. Differences can among others stem from fluid movement or replacement, i.e. oil, gas, or brine, as well as, changes in the rock matrix due to compaction, temperature changes, and movement of injected CO\textsubscript{2} plumes. Usually, a simple difference of the 3D seismic volumes will not yield satisfactory results due to small-scale fluctuations in both arrival times and amplitudes, making time-shift analysis a vital process to match the reflection events. These time-shift values are a valuable source of information themselves \citep{hall2002time,Hatchell2005-eg}, considering their sole dependence on wavefield kinematics, time shifts tend to be a more robust measurement than amplitude differences \citep{Johnston2013-jg}.</p>
<p>Considering normal incidence on a horizontal layer of thickness $z$ and a P-wave velocity $v$ with a traveltime $t$, we can express the changes in traveltime as:</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta t}{t} = \frac{\Delta z}{z} - \frac{\Delta v}{v},
\label{eq:timestrain}
\end{equation}
for homogeneous isotropic $v$ and small changes in $z$ and $v$. Originally developed in \citet{Hatchell2005-eg}, with a rigorous integral derivation presented in \citet{macbeth2019post}.</p>
<p>The vertical strain $\frac{\Delta z}{z}$ directly relates to the geomechanical strain $\xi_{zz}$, describing the vertical strain on the vertical surface of an infinitesimal element \citep{Herwanger2015-qz}. Independently \citet{Hatchell2005-eg} and \citet{roste2006estimation} developed a single-parameter solution to relate velocity changes and vertical strain</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\frac{\Delta v}{v} = - R \xi_{zz}
\label{eq:R}
\end{equation}
with $R$ being the single parameter \ac{hbr}-factor \citep{Hatchell2005-op, macbeth2019post}. The \ac{hbr} being a lithological constant, we can relate \cref{eq:R} and \cref{eq:timestrain} and obtain a direct relationship between the vertical strain $\xi_{zz}$ and the time shift $\Delta t$ for a given lithology with property $R$</p>
<p>\begin{equation}
\Delta t = t \cdot (1 + R) \cdot \xi_{zz}.
\end{equation}</p>
<p>Contingent on the assumption of zero-offset incidence, homogeneous velocity and isotropy, time-shift extraction is mostly performed in the z-direction by comparing traces directly. Prominently, the 1D windowed cross-correlation is used due to its computational speed and general lack of limiting underlying assumptions \citep{Rickett2001-nx}. The main drawback of this method is, however, that the result is highly dependent on the window-size and susceptible to noise. Other methods for post-stack seismic time shift extraction include \ac{dtw} \citep{Hale2013} and inversion-based approaches \citep{Rickett2007-yo}.</p>
<p>More recently, research into pre-stack time shift extraction and 3D-based methods has been conducted. These methods relax the constraints of some assumptions of 1D applications \citep{ghaderi2005pre, hall2002time}. 3D time shifts can capture the subsurface movement of reflectors and account for 3D effects of the $\Delta R / \Delta S$ acquisition mismatch, which effect seismic illumination.</p>
<p>\acf{qi} extends the interpretation of 4D changes to estimate fluid saturation and pressure changes within the reservoir. The subsurface changes recorded by the seismic data can be related numerically to subsurface changes. \citet{tarantola2005inverse} defines the scientific procedure for the study of a physical system loosely as a three-step process involving parameterization of the system, forward modelling, and inverse modelling, additionally defining the inversion as the only deductive method. The inversion process is usually non-unique, where multiple causal processes could explain an observation. Therefore prior information can often be beneficial in applications such as Bayesian inversion. In 4D seismic data particularly, decoupling of pressure and saturation changes is non-trivial and relies on pre-stack or angle-stack information \citep{Landro2001-rz}. This process is, however, highly desirable with the benefit of quantifying the subsurface changes from observed seismic data directly.</p>
<p>Active areas of research in 4D seismic are the use of 4D seismic data to estimate saturation and pressure changes quantitatively, however, these approaches often depend on reliable rock-physics models. Moreover, volumetric time-shift estimation as opposed to trace-wise time-shift extraction, is particularly beneficial to quantitative pre-stack seismic analysis. Additional research in extractive data-based methods and model-based approaches investigate how much information is available directly from the data and what information is available from the modelling feedback-loop.</p>
<p>Lately there has been an increased focus on using machine learning in 4D seismic and the wider field of geoscience. Many 4D seismic approaches depend on statistical methods, one example being time-shift extraction by trace-wise windowed cross-correlation, which lends itself to machine learning applications. The next chapter will give a detailed review of the use of machine learning in geoscience, while introducing important theoretical concepts for this thesis.

abstract = {In 2012 Maersk Oil acquired an Ocean Bottom Node (OBN) seismic survey over the Dan Field located in shallow water in the Danish North Sea. The survey took place shortly after a regional multi-field 4D monitor streamer survey which included the area around the Dan Field. The primary objective of the OBN survey was to acquire data in an area affected by surface infrastructure not accessible with streamer technology. Secondary objectives included evaluating the imaging results in comparison with streamer technology on a field wide scale and evaluating the matching quality between the vintage streamer and OBN survey data. Significant challenges due to the shallow water environment were overcome during operations as well as processing. The results show a clear improvement with the OBN data in the area affected by the platforms when compared to the streamer data in-filled with conventional two boat undershooting. The OBN image is of a similar or better quality over most of the field when compared to the streamer result allowing for different strategic options for future seismic surveys in this area.},

abstract = {The orientation of fluid contacts in chalk fields of the southern North Sea is influenced by a regional hydrodynamic gradient in the chalk aquifer. This paper describes how dipping contacts have been modelled in the Kraka field by integration of geophysical, geological, petrophysical and reservoir engineering data. The Kraka field is a thin oil accuumulation developed with long horizontal wells. The main reservoir is fractured chalk of Palaeocene (Danian) age. The field is located in the southern part of the Danish North Sea. The orientation of the fracture free water level (FWL) in Kraka was initially inferred from a lateral gradient in the virgin aquifer pressures between three wells. Subsequently, during the process of matching a theoretical saturation curve to the logged water saturations, a tilt of the matrix oil-water contact (OWC) was identified. In order to model this tilt it was necessary to assume a FWL with the same orientation as the fracture FWL interpreted from pressure data. Further support of the existence of dipping fluid levels was provided by a seismically mapped dipping planar anomaly interpreted as a fluid contact. The outline of this anomaly is in very good agreement with the OWC obtained from saturation modelling. Thus, three data sources (pressures, saturation modelling and seismic mapping) have independently provided evidence of tilted fluid contacts in the Kraka field. The validity of the model has subsequently been supported by data from new wells.},

abstract = {The Central Graben area was filled with a thick pile of sediments during the Middle Miocene – Quaternary, corresponding to a period of 15Ma. As hydrocarbon expulsion from the most prolific source rock, the Upper Jurassic Bo Member, was initiated only 20 Ma BP and still occurs today, the Middle Miocene – Quaternary evolution is important. In the Middle Miocene, the Central Graben area was covered by a sea with water depth of 500–700 m. During the Late Miocene (Tortonian), the basin was successively filled by prograding slope and deltaic sediments from the northeast. The progradational infill resulted in local tilting of the substratum due to the loading effect of the deposits. In the latest Late Miocene (Messinian), the main input of sediments occurred from the south, as illustrated by a thick onlapping succession of upper Messinian sediments. Pliocene sedimentation was characterized by regular infill from the east within a shelf to shallow marine depositional environment. Following the Miocene and Pliocene, the North Sea Basin tilted due to strong uplift of the Fennoscandian shield and increased subsidence and sedimentation rates within the Central Graben area. This further complicated the maturation of the source rock, migration pathways and accumulation of hydrocarbons. The consequence of this complex burial history is exemplified by the Kraka and Halfdan fields. The Kraka Field has a large down-flank oil accumulation, which is the result of a porosity anomaly resulting from an early invasion of oil in this position before the late tilting of the North Sea Basin. The history of the non-structural accumulation of the Halfdan Field can be readily modelled; it constituted a simple four-way dip closure during the Late Miocene when peak oil migration occurred. The Quaternary tilting of the North Sea Basin due to uplift of the Fennoscandian Shield and strong subsidence of the Central Graben area resulted in a distinct gradient favouring long-distance migration of hydrocarbons. The occurrence of viable migration routes, especially within Paleocene sand layers, has resulted in long-distance migration of oil into the Siri submarine valley system. The most northern indication of hydrocarbons has been recognized as far as 75km from the source area. Long distance migration of hydrocarbons is also indicated by direct hydrocarbon indications (DHIs) throughout the Cenozoic succession in the Danish North Sea. DHIs are particularly prominent above known hydrocarbon accumulations in the Central Graben. This indicates pronounced vertical migration, for instance along active faults, above these structures.},

abstract = {The integration of 3D seismic data, well logs and synthetic seismic data has been used to identify an additional Intra Danian seismic horizon in the chalk reservoir of the Kraka Field, Danish North Sea. Mapping of this seismic horizon has allowed production of a separate thickness map for the main reservoir unit, the Danian Porous, in the greater Kraka area. The unit is less than 25 m thick in most areas and, to produce reliable reservoir maps, it has been necessary to use well data to guide the seismic interpretation. It is impossible, however, to resolve the reservoir stratigraphy properly in areas where the Danian Porous is thinner than c.15 m due to tuning effects. The lateral porosity distribution has been mapped using a combination of well log data and seismic data inverted for acoustic impedance. The Danian Porous unit is characterized by average porosities over 28{\%} and shows no evidence of depth-related porosity reduction. Rather, the impedance data indicate the presence of positive porosity anomalies both over the crest and downflank towards the southeast. Comparison of impedance-derived porosities with those derived from well data indicates that the seismic-based data reflect the variations in porosity but underestimate the highest porosity by 3–4{\%}. Faults and fractures are important for production of the Kraka Field. Detailed mapping of seismic horizons, supplemented with seismic attribute mapping, has proved useful for outlining areas with high fault intensity in the northwestern part of the field but has been unsuccessful in identifying individual faults as recognized from log data},

abstract = {The Danish oil and gas production mainly comes from fields with chalk reservoirs of Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) and early Paleocene (Danian) ages located in the southern part of the Danish Central Graben in the North Sea. The area is mature with respect to exploration with most chalk fields located in structural traps known since the 1970s. However, the discovery by M{\ae}rsk Oil and Gas A/S of the large non- structurally and dynamically trapped oil accumulation of the Halfdan Field in 1999 north-west of the Dan Field (e.g. Albrechtsen et al. 2001) triggered renewed exploration inter- est. This led to acquisition of new high quality 3-D seismic data that considerably enhanced imaging of different depo- sitional features within the Chalk Group. Parallel to the en- deavours by the operator to locate additional non-structural traps in porous chalk, the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland took advantage of the new data to unravel basin development by combining 3-D seismic interpretation of a large number of seismic markers, well log correlations and 2-D seismic inversion for prediction of the distribution of porous intervals in the Chalk Group. Part of this study is presented by Abramovitz et al. (in press). In the present pa- per we focus on aspects of the general structural development during the Late Cretaceous as illustrated by semi-regional time-isochore maps. The Chalk Group has been divided into two seismically mappable units (a Cenomanian–Campanian lower Chalk Unit and a Maastrichtian–Danian upper Chalk Unit) separated by a distinct basin-wide unconformity.},

The diagnostics have led to optimized drilling and near field appraisal, maturation of wells, identification of remaining potential and insight to water flooding dynamics.

abstract = {This paper documents a modeling study detailing some predicted seismic signatures of production-related changes in chalk reservoirs of the Danish North Sea. Our objective was to provide a rock physics analysis as a gateway to understanding the seismic signatures of porosity, compaction, pore fluids, pressure, temperature and induced fractures, with particular application to time-lapse seismic. The study was performed in steps, including: 1) laboratory measurements of compressional and shear velocity, porosity, texture and mineralogy on core plugs, 2) analysis of core and log data in order to build an elastic model relating the parameters, 3) specification of physical parameters associated with various production scenarios, 4) modeling the seismic signatures that would result from hydrocarbon production, differential compaction and water injection. Results of the study indicate that the elastic model built for the chalk reservoirs is consistent at the core plug, electric log, and seismic scales, and can be applied to the entire geographic area from the Gorm, Kraka, Dan and Halfdan reservoirs, and possibly to other chalk reservoirs within the North Sea. Changes to the rock properties induced by production of hydrocarbons and/or injection of water can be expected to produce measurable and visible changes to the seismic data recorded at the surface. Seismic changes can be differences in reflection amplitude, AVO intercept and gradient changes, or differences in travel time. For the scenarios modeled, the greatest differences in seismic response occur during compaction of the reservoir and resulting subsidence of the overburden. This gives about 50 pet. change in RMS amplitude of the reflection from the top and base of the reservoir, and also a measurable change in travel time. Other effects modeled (e.g. water injection, movement of the OWC or the GOC) result in changes from 8-15 pet. in seismic amplitudes, many of which should be observable on a repeated surface seismic survey. This study, therefore, supports the idea that time-lapse seismic surveys may provide useful information for infill drilling, re-development and incremental development projects directed at improving hydrocarbon recovery in the producing chalk fields of Denmark.},

abstract = {This paper documents a field test of time-lapse (4D) seismic covering part of the Dan Field in the Danish North Sea. Results indicate seismic detection of production-related changes in chalk reservoirs is possible. Modelling studies for time-lapse feasibility had been ongoing in these reservoirs since 1992, but without convincing evidence that field trials would be successful. Early studies considering the effects of fluid saturation changes in the reservoir concluded that the magnitude of changes in the seismic response might be below the minimum needed for detectability. The opportunity for a field test of the method occurred when seismic data acquired in 2000 repeated coverage over part of the Dan Field. The original 3D seismic survey covering the field was acquired in 1988. The 4D seismic field test was thus an attempt to see whether the changes to the reservoir that had occurred over a period of twelve years could be detected by time-lapse studies and whether this information could be exploited. An initial post-stack comparison of the two surveys performed in 2001 identified a number of changes that correlated with known water injection perforation locations in the Dan B-Block. A detailed modelling study was then conducted to determine if production and injection activities would cause a detectable change in seismic response and to predict the magnitude of that response. Modelling results indicated that the changes in reservoir conditions would impart an acoustic impedance difference in the range of 5-50 percent, which is considered to be above the detection threshold.},

abstract = {Reservoir pressure maintenance and sweep of oil with water are the main objectives of the Halfdan field water flooding. The lower mobility of water compared to oil in the Halfdan field facilitates an effective sweep of oil but means that the water injectors require larger reservoir contact area in order to replace voidage. In Halfdan this has been the focus from first development and has been obtained by controlled formation of 10,000-15,000 ft long injection fractures by injection at fracturing conditions. Modelling has indicated that conditions for propagating injection fractures along the horizontal injectors were present, but until recently a field-wide verification of the expected uniform sweep has been pending seismic identification of the resulting water flood. After five years of production, a seismic survey was acquired covering the developed area. Analysis of the seismic data has revealed a strong signature reflecting the water flooding of the reservoir. The seismic imaging of the sweep patterns is observed directly in the 3-D data without any 4-D processing and is of an outstanding quality even compared to what is normally seen in dedicated time lapse seismic studies. The seismic observations confirm the modelled behaviour of the Halfdan field water flood. This paper presents examples of the seismic observations made and discusses these in a rock physics context including fluid substitution and pressure effects on acoustic impedance. It is demonstrated how the seismic results together with simple analytical models add to the quantitative description of injection under fracturing conditions by facilitating measures of fracture height, connectivity and extent.

The rock physics model shows that increased water saturation due to the water flooding along the injectors in the Tor oil-bearing reservoir dominates the 4D change in acoustic impedance yielding a hardening response. The rock physics model was used to convert the reservoir model pressure and saturation changes from the three time-steps to modelled acoustic impedance changes.

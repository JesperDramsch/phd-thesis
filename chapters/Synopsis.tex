\chapter{Synopsis}
\label{sec:synopsis}
The following chapters are comprised of four journal papers that are supplemented with two conference papers and four workshop papers, of which all are peer-reviewed or submitted to peer-reviewed journals. I combine several papers into topical chapters for conciseness. This thesis follows a data science workflow, starting with exploratory data analysis to gain insight to the specific geology and field. I go on to present groundwork on machine learning and data processing on 4D seismic data. Based on this groundwork, I developed a method for 4D seismic inversion a novel unsupervised 3D time-shift extraction method for 4D seismic. This chapter summarizes these papers and places them in the appropriate context for the thesis.

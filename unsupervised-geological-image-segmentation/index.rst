-----------

Analysis of chalk samples can be done by bsem. The resulting images
contain black-white images of the sample that can be measured and
analysed. The back-scatter measurements add information regarding the
chemical composition from the back-scattered energy from the electron
beam. Research into the porosity and sedimentology of the chalk
reservoirs conducted using electron microscopes. Identifying the grain
size and orientation of the oolites is usually a manual work-intensive
task, ideal for computer vision tasks, considering the good contrast of
light-grey to white oolites and the black background.
`[fig:bsem] <#fig:bsem>`__ shows a chalk sample from the analysis. The
chalk grains are of varying size, with inter- and intra-grain porosity.
The intra-grain porosity is best seen in the grain located at
:math:`(1000, 200)` in `[fig:bsem] <#fig:bsem>`__. bsem data is noisy,
which can distort the image. Additionally, grain boundaries tend to be
jagged, which is aggravated by the noise.

Unsupervised Image Segmentation
-------------------------------

Labelled training data was not available to apply cnns to this problem.
Instead of hand-labelling the data, unsupervised clustering was
appropriate to find the optimal boundary of the grains from the
background. gmms learned a two-fold representation that separated the
background well from the rock. Clustering the pixel intensity into two
clusters with the gmm and classical histogram boundary are displayed in
`12.1 <#fig:GMMloglikelihood>`__. These boundaries do not coincide, and
while they are close, the two-pixel difference changes the prediction
significantly.

Gaussian Mixture Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In detail, the gmm can model normally distributed sub-populations that
constitute a larger population. The Gaussian distributions are usually
estimated by using the maximum likelihood method. Because
differentiating the log-likelihood is computationally infeasible,
commonly, the expectation maximisation (EM) is utilised to approximate
the maximum log-likelihood. EM is an iterative approach that calculates
the expectation of a sample to be part of a component and maximisation,
which updates the model parameters.

We define :math:`{x} = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)` as the data points with
:math:`n` independent observations. Then
:math:`{z} = (z_1, z_2, ..., z_n)` is the latent vector and
:math:`X_i | (Z_i = k) \propto \mathcal{N}_d(\mu_1, \Sigma_1)` for
:math:`k` compononents and a :math:`d`-dimensional Gaussian. Then the
distribution

.. math:: p(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^k \phi_i \mathcal{N}({x}|{\mu}_i, \Sigma_i),

where :math:`\phi_i` are the model weights and normalize to

.. math:: \sum\limits_{i=1}^K \phi_i = 1.

The Expectation step calculates the membership probabilities for all
samples :math:`i` and components :math:`k`:

.. math:: \hat{\gamma}_{ik} = \frac{\hat{\phi}_k \mathcal{N}(x_i | \hat{\mu}_k, \hat{\sigma}_k)}{\sum\limits^K_{j=1}\hat{\phi}_j\mathcal{N}(x_i|\hat{\mu}_j, \hat{\sigma}_j)}

then the estimated :math:`\hat{\gamma}_{ik}` describes the probability
that a sample :math:`x_i` is generated by the :math:`k`-th component
:math:`C_k`, leading to the conditional probability
:math:`\hat{\gamma}_{ik} = p(C_k|x_i, \hat{\phi},\hat{\mu},\hat{\sigma})`.

The Maximization step then updates the parameter set
:math:`(\hat{\phi}, \hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma})` for all k:

.. math:: \hat{\phi}_k = \sum\limits^N_{i=1} \frac{\hat{\gamma}_{ik}}{N}

.. math:: \hat{\mu}_k = \frac{\sum\limits^N_{i=1} \hat{\gamma}_{ik}x_i}{\sum\limits^N_{i=1} \hat{\gamma}_{ik}}

.. math:: \hat{\sigma}^2_k = \frac{\sum\limits^N_{i=1}\hat{\gamma}_{ik} (x_i - \hat{\mu}_k)^2}{\sum\limits^N_{i=1\hat{\gamma}_{ik}}}

The parameters are initialized by a naive strategy, so that all samples
in :math:`{x}` get randomly assigned to a component and the weights
are uniformly distributed as
:math:`\phi_1, \phi_2, ..., \phi_K = \frac{1}{K}`. The iteration is
stopped when the model converges, that is the expectation of subsequent
steps changes less then a pre-set :math:`\epsilon`.

Morphological Filtering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This single-valued intensity value causes the boundary to be non-smooth
around the grains. Therefore morphological filtering was applied to
smooth out the boundaries programmatically. Smooth boundaries are
essential for chalk grains, as the perimeter of the oolites can be used
to calculate the specific surface of chalk. The optimal boundary of
chalk grains could then be used to generate training data for more
sophisticated machine learning systems.

Mathematical morphology is the theory of analysing geometrical
structures. Morphological filtering implements multiple shape-based
filters that perform non-linear transformations. In this case, we apply
morphological dilation and morphological erosion. Morphological erosion
set the central pixel to the minimum of a neighbourhood. More formally
:math:`A` is a binary image and :math:`B` is a structuring element on
the Euclidean space :math:`E`, e.g. a :math:`3\times3` square, or a disk
with defined radius, then
:math:`A \ominus B = \{z\in E | B_{z} \subseteq A\}`, where :math:`B_z`
is the translation of :math:`B` by the vector :math:`z`. More concisely
morphological erosion is:

.. math:: A \ominus B = \bigcap_{b \in B} A_{-b}

The morphological dilation, in turn, sets a central pixel to the maximum
of the neighbourhood of pixels in an image. Then

.. math:: A \oplus B = \bigcup_{b \in B} A_b

These operations can then be combined to perform morphological opening,
which is commonly used to "clean up" edges in binary images.
Morphological closing can be written as

.. math:: A \circ B  = (A \ominus B) \oplus B.

Repeating erosion and dilation alternatingly smoothes out the boundary
we obtain from gmm.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the oil and gas industry, assessment and prediction of the
hydrocarbon reserves and flow properties throughout a chalk reservoir
lifetime relies, among others, on conventional and special core analysis
(CCAL and SCAL) and computed tomography (CT) imaging in order to
characterise the petrophysical properties and 3-D pore network geometry
of chalk.

The latter laboratory experiments are technically challenging, costly,
and time-consuming and require a large amount of core material. Various
image analysis techniques, studying the 2-D distribution of grains,
pores, and pore throats on thin-sections, have been extensively tested
over more than 50yrs for workflow optimization.

Nevertheless, such techniques have not yet been integrated by reservoir
engineers and geoscientists as a routine task during reservoir
characterization, especially, due to a limited number of samples tested
or a spatially-restricted study area that do not allow the results to be
statistically representative of the chalk heterogeneity across a
reservoir and between oil and gas fields.

Back-scattered electron microscopy (BSEM) analysis historically has been
very manual work. Separating grains from the background, measuring
perimeter and area of the grains. Recently, publications showed
automatic segmentation of BSEM images using computational methods. The
present study represents a robust method in the application of machine
learning on thin-section images collected by BSEM. This cheap and
relatively rapid technique allows to quickly analyse a large number of
pictures that do not need to be manually labeled.

Method
~~~~~~

SEM Analysis as Image Segmentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is an imaging method that allows the
visualisation of the grains and pores of chalk deposits
(Figure `12.2 <#gauss:fig:segment>`__). Grayscale images of the rock
fabric can be collected at various scales of observation, from the
micro-scale, typically single pore and grain, to few tens of microns
where the network of pores can be studied, to the millimetres-scale.
This provides a complete insight of the heterogeneity of each sample.
Nanotube SEM and many applications separate very well the grains from
the background in the SEM images. Therefore, these images can be
segmented by histogram methods. Carbonates and specifically chalk vary
on grayscale, and grains are not illuminated homogeneously. However,
image segmentation has made many improvements in recent years, which
extends the toolkit beyond histogram segmentation.

Modern Neural Networks (NN) can segment images exceptionally well
(Ronneberger, Fischer, and Brox 2015b). Modarres et al. (2017)
investigated the application of NNs to SEM images. However, as with most
applications in Geoscience and supervised learning, we would have to
label a significant amount of images by hand to assure quality or
automatically with subpar methods to train the network adequately. This
defeats the point for this application, therefore, this study
investigates unsupervised methods, which will be assessed in order to
select the one that performs the best across all scales of observation.
Several BSEM images of the rock fabric at the same scale are also
collected to validate the results.

Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) learns a number of joint distributions
approximated by Gaussians in the search space (Lindsay 1995). The number
of Gaussians has to be specified, similar to many clustering methods,
like k-means. In this application, we aim at segmenting the background
from the chalk, which lends itself to specify two Gaussian distributions
as learning parameter to obtain a binary mask, presented in
Figure `12.2 <#gauss:fig:segment>`__.

We apply morphological filtering to clean up the segmentation (Serra and
Vincent 1992). Due to the noisy images of BSEM, the edges of grains
appear fuzzy. For the automatic analysis of the perimeter for instance,
seen in Figure `12.3 <#gauss:fig:filtsem>`__.

Subsequently, we can programmatically analyse the result using
scikit-learn and scikit-image (F. Pedregosa et al. 2011). This provides
area, perimeter and rotation of grains in the image among other
geometrical factors of the grains. These can be very valuable in digital
rock physics and pore analysis.

Conclusions
~~~~~~~~~~~

We present an effective segmentation method for BSEM image data.
Gaussian Mixture Models learn a good representation of the grayscale
data and morphological filtering further improves the results.

Computational Granulometry
--------------------------

Identifying the grains in an bsem image enables us to perform
computational granulometry on the images. The segmented images can be
analysed with standard image processing algorithms that can return
standard measures such as perimeter, area, and eccentricity of grains.
Moreover, depending on the preparation of the chalk sample, the angle of
orientation can be extracted for each grain.

`[fig:grainsizes] <#fig:grainsizes>`__ shows the distribution of grain
sizes over the image. The data shows an even distribution toward smaller
chalk grains, with three very large samples, that can be clearly
identified in `12.4 <#fig:threelargebsem>`__.
`[fig:uncircular] <#fig:uncircular>`__ shows the shape distribution of
the grains, which is distributed toward less circular grains due to
compaction. Nevertheless, there are two strong spikes toward circular
grains which is in accordance with our expectation for chalk oolites.

 

Moreover, this analysis enables us to calculate the approximate porosity
from the image. The porosity calculated is 44.25%. The measured porosity
of the chalk sample is 42%, which is close for a 2D image of the 3D pore
space.

Contributions of this Study
---------------------------

This study introduced unsupervised gmm clustering for chalk grain bsem
image segmentation. Overall, the method shows a very good separation of
the grains from the background in the image. The method performs well on
images with varying lightness, due to the unsupervised nature of the gmm
algorithm. This model, however, benefits from the contrast between the
light chalk grains and the dark background. Nevertheless, it does
outperform classical methods, i.e. a histogram-based analysis.

Morphological filtering improves the segmentation of the image. The
morphological filtering application is computationally efficient and
reliable in removing small scale variations in the data. The
morphological opening smoothes the boundaries between the grain and the
background and remove small grains and possible noise from the binary
labels.

These binary labels enable computational granulometry on the grain data.
This data has good accordance with the image data, as well as measured
porosity on the rock sample. Finally, this method can be used to
generate labels for more complex machine learning models, i.e. cnns.

<p>This chapter discusses transfer learning in asi. Transfer learning is a
technique that uses a dnns pre-trained on a different data set that is
usually larger and more diverse, which is then fine-tuned to the target
data. dnns are notorious for needing large numbers of diverse annotated
samples. That is often prohibitive to geoscience applications of machine learning,
where data is expensive and difficult to acquire, labelling by experts
is complicated and prone to bias (Bond et al. 2007), and often only
available within commercial environments. In (Jesper Sören Dramsch and
Lüthje 2018b) we show that sotas convolutional neural networks pre-trained on a natural image
data set (ImageNet, cf. <a class="reference external" href="#book:dl">2.2.2.4</a>) can be transferred to
perform asi. This paper forms the central contribution of this chapter.</p>
<p>In the computer vision community, hand-labelled data sets like ImageNet,
CIFAR, and PASCAL-VOC are openly available, which catalyzed the
development of new architectures and approaches in deep learning.
Geoscientific data is often expensive to acquire, and companies are
reluctant to make data available, even less so for processed or
interpreted data. Early machine learning workshops often showed results
on the open Dutch F3 dataset; however, national data repositories have
started to change this approach to foster innovation. With data becoming
more available recently, the next problem is the lack of ground truth.
Obtaining accurate labels for seismic data is impossible, as any
inversion process is non-unique and digging is not practical. In other
imaging-based fields (e.g. radiology) that rely on the interpretation of
imaging results, studies investigate both inter-interpreter variations,
by making several interpretations available and intra-interpreter
variability by re-interpreting the dataset after a set time interval
(McErlean et al. 2013; Alikhassi, Gourabi, and Baikpour 2018; Al-Khawari
et al. 2010). Additionally, simulations provide ground truth, but can
implicitly include modelling assumptions in the data or commit the
inverse crime (Wirgin 2004). The inverse crime presents the problem of
modelling and inverting data with the same theoretical ingredients.</p>
<p>In geophysics itself, seismic data presents a unique challenge to
computer vision problems. Displays of seismic data usually clip
amplitudes in the 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> percentile to make most
of the seismic amplitude content visible. These particularly strong
amplitudes make up a very small number of the distribution of
amplitudes. However, they have to be contained within the constant
dynamic range of the data, while adding minimal information gain (Forel,
Benz, and Pennington 2005). Moreover, limiting these outlier amplitudes
decompresses the main distribution of amplitudes over the full dynamic
range. This becomes particularly important when compressing data to
lower bitrates, i.e. from 32-bit floats to 16-bit floats. Clipping
amplitudes has also proven to be a viable preprocessing step before
feeding seismic data to computer vision systems, such as convolutional
neural networks. Machine learning systems have been known to be
vulnerable to noise. This noise can be physical noise (e.g. low snr) for
simpler models or adversarial attacks that reverse engineer more complex
models. These adversarial attacks on machine learning models attempt to
find vulnerabilities in the trained models intentionally. Frequently,
these adversarial attacks can provide insights into edge-behaviours and
susceptibility to noise. Adversarial attacks include a one-pixel attack
on ImageNet classifiers, which changes a single value in an image to
cause a misclassification (Su, Vargas, and Sakurai 2019). Humanly
imperceptible noise changes the digital image so slightly that the human
eye cannot see a change, but the classifier is led to misclassify the
image (I. J. Goodfellow, Shlens, and Szegedy 2014), which is
particularly interesting to physical applications of machine learning,
that can have significant amounts of noise in their data. Alternatively,
even physical printed stickers are used to fool a convolutional neural network in real-world
applications (Brown et al. 2017). Besides, geological data contains
regions of geological interest and regions that are inconsequential to
geological interpretation. This selective interpretation of geological
features, which has been common in seismic interpretation, as well as,
well-log interpretation is challenging to represent in metrics
adequately (S. Purves, Alaei, and Lolis 2019).</p>
<p>Realistically, the limited availability of labelled ground truth data
can be addressed in different ways. In the case when labels are
available but not abundant, transfer learning of highly generalizable
models like VGG-16 can be fine-tuned to seismic data. The VGG-16
architecture can also be included in U-Nets as a decoder to leverage the
benefits of transfer learning in semantic segmentation tasks (Jesper
Sören Dramsch and Lüthje 2018b). Moreover, weakly-supervised training
can perform label propagation of labelled subsections of the full data
set to unlabeled sets. Unsupervised or self-supervised training can be
applicable, where no reliable ground truth is available. Unsupervised
training is applicable, when a desired operation on the data is known,
or an internal structure of the data can be exploited (Jesper Sören
Dramsch, Christensen, et al. 2019). Additionally, multi-task learning
has been shown to be able to stabilize network performance in nlp (X.
Liu et al. 2019) and rl (Yu et al. 2019).</p>
<p>Research into deep convolutional networks showed that the data in the
network would lose signal with increasing depth, named vanishing
gradient problem (Hochreiter 1998). This vanishing gradient problem led
to the limitation of VGG at 19 layers; this is detailed further in
<a class="reference external" href="#ssec-cnnarch">2.2.2.6</a>. Residual blocks introduced a solution to
this problem by implementing a shortcut between the original data and
the output from the block. <a class="reference external" href="#bookchapter-fig-resnet">Chapter 2.14</a> presents
the original ResNet block architecture, which was used in ResNet-50 and
ResNet-101 in <a class="reference external" href="#fig-cnnsota">Figure 4.1</a> (K. He et al. 2016). Details on
ResNet blocks differ, the main take-away being the sum or concatenation
of the original data with the block output. DenseNets (G. Huang et al.
2017) and Inception-style networks (Szegedy et al. 2015) are other
approaches to build deeper neural networks.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p><a class="reference external" href="#fig-cnnsota">Figure 4.1</a> additionally contains several classes of neural network
architectures, namely AmoebaNet, NASNet, and EfficientNet. These
categories are a more recent development in neural architecture
research, based on nas, which automates the search for novel
architectures instead of completely hand-tuning new developments. This
optimization scheme to search for neural architectures has been
developed to include different optimization objectives. The AmoebaNet is
based on ec, a numeric optimization technique mimicking biological
evolution, and subsequent fine-tuning of the solution to search for an
ideal neural architecture to perform image classification (Real et al.
2019). The NASNet goes on with fixed overall architecture, but uses a
controller rnn to modify the blocks within the architecture (Zoph et al.
2018). The EfficientNet architecture was also acquired by nas, by
optimizing for both accuracy and flops. Optimizing for flops reduces the
computational cost of the final architecture (Tan and Le 2019a).
Moreover, Tan and Le (2019a) derives a method of simultaneously scaling
multiple dimensions in deep neural networks named compound scaling. The
standard ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 differ only in-depth, whereas compound
scaling establishes a relationship between depth, width and
resolution-scaling of deep neural networks using a single scaling
parameter.</p>
<p>VGG-16 and ResNet-52 are two network architectures that are used in the
paper in this chapter. These can be identified in
<a class="reference external" href="#fig-cnnsota">Figure 4.1</a>. The performance of both models in the Top-5
accuracy on ImageNet is comparable, while the number of parameters
vastly differ. VGG-16 contains 138 million parameters, while ResNet- 52
contains 23 million parameters, the VGG-16 network is, however, 16
layers deep, while Resnet-52 contains 52 layers. These networks are
compared to the end-to-end trained convolutional neural network built by Anders Waldeland and
Solberg (2016).</p>
<section id="training-and-fine-tuning"><h2>Training and Fine-Tuning</h2>
<p>The training of the three networks in this chapter, namely Waldeland
CNN, VGG-16, and Resnet-52, requires different strategies to obtain
optimal results. The Waldeland convolutional neural network is end-to-end trained on the training
data. The VGG-16 and ResNet-52 are fine-tuned with pre-trained weights,
which require a lower learning rate and fixing the weights in parts of
the network. The networks are trained with the categorical cross-entropy
loss discussed in <a class="reference external" href="#eq-crossentropy">equation [crossentropy]</a>. The
categorical cross-entropy enables training on multi-class labels by
optimizing the multi-variate negative log-likelihood. It is reprinted
here for convenience:</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-crossentropy">
\begin{equation*}
CE = - \sum\limits^C_j y_j \log{\left(o_{j}\right)}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>The VGG-16 model has the first seven layers frozen. The ResNet-52 has
the first 44 layers frozen. This ensures that the most general features
are preserved, while higher abstraction features in layers can be
adjusted to the training data. Moreover, the last layer that outputs the
classification has to be replaced by an appropriate layer, which instead
of predicting 1000 classes for ImageNet, predicts the number of classes
in our training set 9.</p>
<p>The training relies on the custom loader presented in
<a class="reference external" href="#code:loader">[code:loader]</a>. This loader extracts patches from the
2D seismic image and the according label and provides a convenient
generator. This generator can perform the data preparation on CPU while
the training is performed on GPU. Additionally, the training is
monitored to implement an early-stopping procedure. This enables us to
stop the training when the validation loss and validation accuracy
deteriorate. This avoids overfitting of the network, which is
particularly essential when fine-tuning an over-parametrized network to
smaller-scale data.</p>
<section id="end-to-end-convolutional-neural-network-training"><h3>End-to-End convolutional neural network training</h3>
<p>The training of the Waldeland convolutional neural network is trained end-to-end. The optimizer
for the Waldeland convolutional neural network is the Adam optimizer (Diederik P. Kingma and Ba
2014) with a learning rate of <span class="math">\(0.001\)</span>, the decay of first-order
moments of <span class="math">\(\beta_1=0.9\)</span>, and second-order moments of

accuracy on the training data while performing close to perfect on the
test set. The training is stopped after ten epochs. The loss shows that
the model starts overfitting at epoch 7. A dataset with more diverse
labels and samples would improve this situation.</p>
</section><section id="fine-tuning-pre-trained-networks"><h3>Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Networks</h3>
<p>Pre-trained networks were trained on a dataset and made available by the
researchers and companies, including weights and biases. These are often
trained on large corpuses of data. In computer vision, classically
pre-trained networks were trained on ImageNet, CIFAR, and PASCAL-VOC.
The sota networks are pre-trained on up to a billion images with 17,000
labels and subsequently fine-tuned on the ImageNet-1K dataset (Mahajan
et al. 2018). This strategy is applied across deep learning, including
computational linguistics with 175 billion parameters pre-trained on
0.499 trillion words in GPT-3 (Brown et al. 2020). The pre-trained
networks in this chapter were trained on the ImageNet corpus and
transferred to the MaleNov seismic dataset (Ildstad and Bormann 2017).</p>
<p>The VGG-16 and ResNet-52 are finetuned using sgd with Nesterov momentum.
The learning rate for the sgd is set to <span class="math">\(0.0001\)</span>, with a momentum
of <span class="math">\(0.9\)</span>. Additionally, a learning rate schedule is implemented
that updates the learning rate (lr) according to
<span class="math">\(lr(t) = 0.0001 \cdot \left( 1 + 10^{-6} \cdot t \right)^{-1}\)</span>.</p>

<section id="introduction"><span id="introduction-1"></span><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Seismic interpretation is often dependent on the interpreters experience
and knowledge. While deep learning cannot replace expert knowledge, we
explore the accuracy of convolutional networks in interpreting seismic
data to support human interpretation.</p>
<p>In the 1950s neural networks started as a simple direct connection of
several nodes in an input layer to several nodes in an output layer
(Widrow and Lehr 1990). In geophysics this puts us to the introduction
of seismic trace stacking (Öz Yilmaz 2001). In 1989 the first idea of a
convolutional neural network was born (Lecun 1989) and back-propagation
was formalized as an error-propagation mechanism (D. E. Rumelhart,
Hinton, and Williams 1988). In 2012 the paper (Krizhevsky, Sutskever,
and Hinton 2012a) propelled the field of deep learning forward
implementing essential components, namely GPU training, ReLu activation
functions (Dahl, Sainath, and Hinton 2013) and dropout (Srivastava et
al. 2014). They outperformed previous models in the ImageNet challenge
(J. Deng et al. 2009) by almost halving the prediction error. Anders
Waldeland and Solberg (2016) showed that neural networks can be used to
classify salt diapirs in 3D seismic data. Rutherford Ildstad and Bormann
(2017) generalized this work to nD and beyond two classes of salt and
"else".</p>
<p>The task of automatic seismic interpretation can be equated to dense
object detection (T.-Y. Lin et al. 2017) or semantic segmentation. These
tasks are currently best solved by Mask R-CNN architectures (Long,
Shelhamer, and Darrell 2015). Statoil has used U-Nets for automatic
seismic interpretation. Yet, classification networks can be used for
semantic segmentation, but are significantly slower. The benefit is a
testable example of generalization of pre-trained networks form
photographic data to seismic images. As well as, a testable framework
for choosing hyper-parameters for neural networks on seismic data.</p>
<p>Deep learning relies heavily on vast amounts of labeled data to train on
initially. However, the features learned from these networks can often
be transferred to adjacent problem spaces (Baxter 1998). Often these
transfer learning tasks are tested on photographs rather than seismic or
medical imaging tasks. The aim of this study is to evaluate
state-of-the-art pre-trained networks in the task of automatic seismic
interpretation. We compare three convolutional neural networks of
increasing complexity in the task of supervised automatic seismic
interpretation. We evaluate these tasks qualitatively and
quantitatively.</p>
</section><section id="methods"><h3>Methods</h3>
<p>The neural networks in this study learn supervised. The features were
published alongside the open source framework MalenoV and describe nine
seismic facies in the open F3 data set. The classes describe steep
dipping reflectors, salt intrusions, low coherency regions, low
amplitude dipping reflectors, high amplitude regions continuous high
amplitude regions and grizzly amplitude patterns presented in
<a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-labels">Figure 4.7</a>. Additionally, a catch-all “else”
region are picked. In this approach we chose Keras (Chollet and others
2015a) with a Tensorflow (Abadi et al. 2015a) backend on a K5200 GPU at
DHRTC. Keras is a high level abstraction of tensor arithmetics.
Tensorflow is an open source numerical computation library on static
graphs. We train 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) of varying depth
on seismic slices to propagate single slice interpretations to a volume.
CNNs are highly flexible models for computer vision tasks.</p>
<p>Network one depicted in <a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-waldelandcnn">Figure 4.5</a> was
developed by (Anders Waldeland and Solberg 2016) to identify salt bodies
in 3D seismic data. Three layers are fully connected for classification.
The network uses a kernel of 5 by 5 pixels for convolution and a stride
of 2 for down-sampling. We use the Adam optimizer and cross-categorical
entropy as a loss function. The Adam optimizer is an extension to
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) that implements adaptive learning
rates and bias correction (Ruder 2016). We add dropout and batch
normalization to the network. These methods improve regularization and
prevent overfitting. Furthermore, we use early-stopping to prevent
overfitting the model by over-training. We chose two metrics to monitor
in the training and validation sets, namely mean absolute error and
accuracy. The Waldeland convolutional neural network is relatively shallow compared to modern
deep learning networks with 95,735 parameters to optimize for.</p>

</figcaption></figure><p>Network two is the VGG16 network (Simonyan and Zisserman 2014b) by the
Visual Geometry Group. It contains 16 layers and 1,524,2605 parameters.
13 of these layers ore convolutional layers with a 3x3 kernel.
Convolutional blocks are interspersed with max-pooling layers for
down-sampling. The last three layers are fully connected layers for
classification. The VGG16 architecture was proposed for the ImageNet
challenge in 204. It is widely used for it’s simplicity in teaching and
it’s generalizability in transfer learning tasks.</p>
<figure><img alt="VGG16 architecture. Same visualization as" id="transfer-fig-vgg" src="../images/vgg.png"><figcaption><p>VGG16 architecture. Same visualization as <a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-waldelandcnn">Figure 4.5</a></p>
</figcaption></figure><p>Network three is the ResNet50 architecture by Microsoft. The network
consists of 50 layers with 2,361,6569 parameters. It implements a recent
development, called residual blocks. These residual blocks add a skip-
or identity-connection around a stack of 1x1, 3x3, 1x1 convolutional
layers (K. He et al. 2016). The 1x1 are identity convolutions, used for
down- and subsequent up-sampling to decrease the computational cost of
very deep convolutional neural networks. The convolutional layers are followed by one fully
connected layer for classification.</p>
<p>All networks use rectified linear units (ReLu) as neural activation. The
last layer uses Softmax as activation to output a probability for each
class. Training both VGG16 and the ResNet50 end to end would be very
expensive. These models have been trained on big labeled data that are
not available in geoscience. However, transfer learning enables us to
use pre-trained networks on very different tasks. In transfer learning,
we use the learned weights of the networks and replace the fully
connected layers. These untrained layers are specific to our task and
have to be fine-tuned to the data. This process is very fast and
requires little data. We fine-tune an entire network on one sparsely
interpreted 2D seismic slice. For the fine-tuning process, we replace
the Adam optimizer by a classic SGD optimizer with lower learning rate,
very low weight decay and Nesterov momentum. We still use early-stopping
on validation loss and cross-categorical entropy.</p>
<p>We added the same fully connected layer architecture to VGG16 and
ResNet50 that Waldeland added to their architecture. Therefore, we test
if pre-trained convolution kernels are fit to recognize texture features
in seismic data. We set up a validation set to quantify the accuracy of
our networks on previously unseen data. Additionally, we set up a
prediction pipeline to populate each one 2D inline and crossline of the
seismic data to qualitatively visualize the prediction capability of the
networks. The labels for the supervised interpretation are taken from
the MalenoV interpretation by ConocoPhillips, shown in
<a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-labels">Figure 4.7</a>.</p>

<p>We use the open Dutch F3 data set to calibrate our predictions.
Crossline 339 has been interpreted by ConocoPhillips and made available
freely. We show results of crossline slice 500. We have used the same
plotting parameters for both either results, both have been generated
programatically, without human intervention.
<a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-predi">Figure 4.8 (a)</a> shows the
prediction of the Waldeland convolutional neural network at every location of the 2D slice based
on a 65 x 65 patch of the data. Border patches were zero padded. We see
clear patches for the low coherency region in brown. The low amplitude
dipping (grass green) region has been reproduced well, however some
regions at <span class="math">\(t\approx1080~\text{ms}\)</span> have been marked incorrectly,
where two seismic packages meet. This faulty region also contains
patches that were interpreted as low amplitude region (yellow). While
this may be a low amplitude region, we expect the packages to be largely
continuous, which leaves this interpretation as questionable at best.
The gray area was reproduced well, however it was marked as salt body in
the original manuscript, this would be incorrect here. We see the
grizzly amplitude pattern (orange) and the low amplitude (yellow)
regions are well-defined and separated. The underlying package of high
amplitudes has been identified will. However, between location 600 - 800
the top part was marked as "else" (turquoise), which undesirable but
correct, judging from the texture. Here, retraining would be possible by
feeding this relabeled region to the network. Below this region, the
networks predictions become erratic. The classification is blocky
between grizzly and salt with "else" interspersed. However, the edges
will often give problems due to the padding. Around location 800 high
amplitudes (orange) have been mislabeled as grizzly amplitudes.</p>
<p>The VGG16 network classification is shown in
<a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-vggpredi">Figure 4.8 (b)</a>. The network
performs similar to the Waldeland convolutional neural network in
<a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-predi">Figure 4.8 (a)</a>, however some key
differences will be pointed out. The separation of low coherency and the
"else" region around <span class="math">\(t\approx400~\text{ms}\)</span> is less defined and,
therefore, worse. The coherency of low amplitude dipping (grass green)
and high amplitude continuous (blue) is worse in the region around
location 280, <span class="math">\(t\approx800~\text{ms}\)</span>. This might be due to higher
sensitivity to declines in seismic quality. Below
<span class="math">\(t\approx1000~\text{ms}\)</span> the "else" region is free from differing
patches, in contrast, the Waldeland convolutional neural network interspersed two other classes
in this region. VGG16 also classifies some "else" regions in the high
amplitude (magenta) region between location 600-800. The area around
location 200 below the high amplitude (magenta) region is also blocky,
although less so. The misclassification of the bottom high amplitude
(magenta) region as grizzly (orange) is less pronounced in the VGG16
interpretation. It is present toward the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>The results of the ResNet50 are not shown. The network classifies all
seismic facies as "else". This indicates that the network is overfitting
the data. This is supported by the numeric results presented in
table <a class="reference external" href="#tab:scores">Figure 4.1</a>. The network training error indicates a
perfect fit to the data, whereas the test score is unseen data with
labels to evaluate the performance of networks on unseen data. While
both the Waldeland convolutional neural network and VGG16 perform well, the ResNet50 performs
very poorly.</p>

</section><section id="conclusion"><h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Convolutional neural networks show good results for propagating
interpretations through seismic cubes. The pre-trained VGG16 convolutional neural network has
shown very good results in adapting to seismic texture identification.
Transfer learning was fast and the results are similar to the shallower
Waldeland convolutional neural network. Both networks have trade-offs in the misclassification
and can be improved upon.</p>
<p>The ResNet50 was shown to be ineffective on transfer learning seismic
data with pre-trained weights. This is in accordance with results from
other attempts at transfer learning. The ResNet filters are more
specific to photography and transfer poorly to other data sources, where
the VGG learned features prove to be more general to computer vision
tasks. More complicated architectures may perform well, trained directly
with the according data, but they learn specific features fit for the
problem space that do not transfer well.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-predi">Figure 4.8 (a)</a> shows the results of a
fully trained network compared to a pre-trained network. The pre-trained
network decreases both training time and data requirements
significantly, while not compromising accuracy. A pre-trained network
with diverse generalizable learned filters seems to alleviate some
limitations of smaller non-diverse data sets used in the fine-tuning
process. These pre-trained networks themselves are of little use to most
applications in geoscience. Nevertheless, they can be integrated into
more task-appropriate neural network architectures that leverage the pre-training.</p>
<p>Apart from building deeper networks for image classification, the neural
architectures can serve as a forcing function to the task the network is
built for. Encoder-Decoder networks will compress the data with a
combination of downsampling layers, which in the case of a computer
vision could either be strided convolutions or pooling layers after
convolutional layers. During these operations, the number of filters
increases, while the spatial extent is diminished significantly. This
encoding operation is equivalent to lossy compression, with the
low-dimensional layer called "code" or "bottleneck". The bottleneck is
then upsampled by either strided transpose Convolutions or upsampling
layers that perform a specified interpolation. This is the decoder of
the Encoder-Decoder pair. These networks can be used for data
compression in aes, where the decoder restores the original data as good
as possible (Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2006). Alternatively, the decoder
can learn a dense classification task like semantic segmentation or
seismic interpretation.</p>
<p>U-Nets present a special type of encoder-decoder networks that learn
semantic segmentation on from small datasets (Ronneberger, Fischer, and
Brox 2015a). They form a special kind of fcn shown in
<a class="reference external" href="#bookchapter-fig-unet">Chapter 2.15</a>. Originally developed on biomedical
images, the network found wide acceptance in label-sparse disciplines.
The U-Net implements shortcut connections between convolutional layers
of equal extent in the Encoder and Decoder networks. This alleviates the
pressure of the network learning and reconstructing the output data from
the bottleneck in isolation.</p>
<p>The data set in this training is very small and non-diverse as shown in
<a class="reference external" href="#transfer-fig-labels">Figure 4.7</a> and this only made training on a
classification network possible. Image segmentation would need a dense
labelling of the training data and more than one 2D section available.
This has been approached by Alaudah et al. (2019) by labelling the full
Dutch F3 dataset, which cites the paper presented here. Modern
applications of transfer learning were able to leverage ResNet
architectures as an encoder in U-nets on seismic data (Babakhin,
Sanakoyeu, and Kitamura 2019a).</p>
</section><section id="contributions-of-this-study"><span id="contributions-of-this-study-2"></span><h2>Contributions of this Study</h2>
<p>This study introduced transfer learning for deep learning tasks in asi
and has found an application across geophysics (see e.g. Babakhin,
Sanakoyeu, and Kitamura 2019b; G. Li et al. 2019; M. Liu et al. 2019).
The transfer learning enables utilizing neural networks that were
trained on a diverse dataset and then fine-tuning them with data that
contains far fewer samples. This outperforms smaller networks that can
be trained end-to-end on these small datasets. The code is available at <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JesperDramsch/seismic-transfer-learning">https://github.com/JesperDramsch/seismic-transfer-learning</a>.</p>

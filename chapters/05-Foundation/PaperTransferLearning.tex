\section{Deep learning seismic facies on state of the art CNN architectures}

\paragraph{Abstract:} We explore propagation of seismic interpretation by deep learning in stacked 2D sections. We show the application of state-of-the-art image classification algorithms on seismic data. These algorithms were trained on big labeled photograph databases. We use transfer learning to benefit from pre-trained networks and evaluate their performance on seismic data.

\subsection*{Key points:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pre-trained \aclp{cnn} transfer to seismic
    \item Outperforms smaller \acp{cnn} trained from scratch
    \item Enables training in data sparse environments
\end{itemize}
